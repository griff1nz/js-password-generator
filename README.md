# Password Generator

## Description
- I made this website to demonstrate my ability to write a simple JavaScript program.
- This program involves several different aspects of JavaScript, including writing functions, for loops, while loops, and prompts.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Upon clicking the "Generate Password" button, the user will see a series of prompts: the desired length of the password, followed by whether or not they would like to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The user must select at least one to include.
